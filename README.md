# README

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges. Tests for each challenge have been written using rspec. The 
Rubocop linter has been used and all warnings have been resolved.

* Ruby version 3.0.3

* To run the tests navigate to the main directory of the repo and run 'bundle exec rspec spec' for all the tests or
'bundle exec rspec spec/[CHALLENGE NAME]_spec.rb' for an individual challenge
